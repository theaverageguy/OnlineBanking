# OnlineBankingSystem
Online Banking System with login, update profile and money transfer facilities.

Instructions:

1. Clone this repo in eclipse.
2. The database layout is present in "database_schema" file inside WebContent directory. Just copy paste commands in MySQL command line client to populate the database.
3. Run "index.html" once your database is created. "index.html" is present in WebContent directory.
3. I have made login html page and done authentication. You can find username and passwords in "databse_schema" to login.
4. Once you get authenticated you will get redirected to "CustomerHome" servlet. This servlet handles the home page of customer once he gets successfully logged in. You will find info of customer in this page.
5. You have to modify and work with this servlet to add "update profile" and "transfer money" functionality to the web-app.
6. You can use my HTML layout (you will find it in index.html).

Feel free to contact me in case on any problem.
